        <p>I am 25 years old now and finally got through a decent job interview from a Japanese company. 
            As I'm not currently working, the result was dissapointing but the interview itself was good experience.
            Although I was expecting the meeting was going to be much more formal, it was procedded much more casually.
            Instead of acting on the interview, I was able to discuss with the interviewer about what companies require from candidates.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li >Smooth communications (preferably on site)</li>
            <li>Outstanding strength</li>
            <li>Business idea</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Smooth communications (preferably on site)</h2>
        <p>Smooth communication can be the most critical when they are choosing employees and this could be the exact reason that I was not choosed. 
            As they require seemless communications with clients and in company, candidates who want to work remotely are likely to be avoided. 
            In other words, There are many chances for people in Japan to work in these web development companies.</p>
        <h2>Outstanding strength</h2>
        <p>
            You need something strong to persuade them to hire yourself, such as achievements from your web developing.
        </p>
        <h2>Business idea</h2>
        <p>
            You may be required something new to them.
        </p>

        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <p>
            In conclusion, 
            most important thing for the web developers in Japan is to be on site especially if you are becomming a Graduate developer.
            Other factors that can impress the companies may help you to get hired.
